This add-on adds a ZAP browser extension to both Firefox and Chrome when they are launched from ZAP.
<p>
The extensions stream significant browser based events back to ZAP, giving ZAP an insight into what is going on in the browser.
<p>
If you do not launch your browser(s) from ZAP then you can still install these extensions directly from the relevant stores:

<ul>
<li>Firefox <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/zap-browser-extension">ZAP Browser Extension</a>
<li>Chrome <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/zap-browser-extension/cnmficmodhagepcmhogkbdakncebckho">ZAP Browser Extension</a>
</ul>

Note that you may need to configure the extensions via their options pages to update the host and API key.

<h2>User Interface</h2>

The add-on adds 3 new tabs to ZAP:

<h3>Client Map</h3>

The Client Map is a hierarchical representation of the sites visited, and is similar in some ways to the Sites Tree.
It includes nodes which represent URLs and ones which represent browser based storage.
<p>
Unlike the Sites Tree it includes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URI_fragment">URI fragments</a> which ZAP cannot otherwise see.
This means that the Client Map looks very different to the Sites tree for modern web apps, and may give you a better understanding of the
client side structure of the sites.
<p>
Any leaf nodes in the Map with a small red 'minus' sign represent URLs which have been found in the DOM but which have not been directly accessed by ZAP.
<p>
Selecting a node that has been visited by ZAP will display details about that node in the Client Details tab.

<h3>Client Details</h3>

The Client Details tab shows details about Client Map nodes.
<p>
The types of data displayed include:
<ul>
<li>Button: Buttons detected in the DOM 
<li>Cookies: Cookies set in the browser
<li>FORM: Forms detected in the DOM 
<li>Input: Input elements detected in the DOM 
<li>Link: Links detected in the DOM 
</ul>

<h3>Client History</h3>

The Client History tab shows all of the client side events sent from the browser extension to ZAP.
<p>
In addition to the data displayed in the Client Details tab it also includes:

<ul>
<li>DOM Mutation: Browser <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver">MutationObserver</a> event 
<li>Node Added: A DOM node added to the specified URL 
<li>Page Load: Browser <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/load_event">load</a> event 
<li>Page Unload: Browser <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/unload_event">unload</a> event 
</ul>

<h2>AJAX Spider Enhancement</h2>

This add-on provides an <a href="ajax-scan.html">AJAX Spider Enhancement</a> which can detect URLs referenced in the DOM which were not
be accessed by the spider.

<h2>Firefox Profile</h2>

It also creates a <a href="firefox-profile.html">Firefox profile</a> and sets it as the default profile that ZAP will use.

<p>
For more details on how the add-on works see the <a href="internals.html">internals</a> page.
